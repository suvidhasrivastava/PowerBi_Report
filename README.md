4)Drag the product subcategory field to the axis and the count of items ordered to the values section.
5)Format the chart as needed, adding titles, labels, and adjusting colors for better readability

##Scatterplot of Retail Price vs. Discounted Price:

2)Create a new report and add a scatterplot to the canvas.
3)Place the retail price on the x-axis and the discounted price on the y-axis.
4)Customize the scatterplot by adding labels, titles, and tooltips to display relevant information.
5)You may also want to use color or size encoding for additional insights.

##Lineplot for Monthly Revenue by Country:

1)Import the dataset containing information on monthly revenue for the E-Commerce company, with details on countries.
2)Create a new report and add a line chart to the canvas.
3)Place the month field on the x-axis, revenue on the y-axis, and use the 'Country' field to create separate lines for each country.
4)Adjust the time granularity to monthly and ensure that the data is sorted chronologically.
5)Enhance the visualization by formatting the axes, adding data labels, and providing a title for clarity.


Remember to regularly update the Power BI report with fresh data and consider incorporating filters or slicers for interactivity, allowing users to explore the information more dynamically. Additionally, document your steps and choices in the report to make it user-friendly for others who might use or modify it.
